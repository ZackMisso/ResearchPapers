Purpose: Proposed system where the user defines the degrees of freedom
  and the rest are automatically inferred using nonlinear, rigidity energies

What is Fast Variational Shape Modeling?

Articulation has two steps:
  Rigging - setting how the parameters control the geometry
  Deformation - calculates the shape based on parameters

Joint angles are usually the most popular articulation parameter
Others:
  free-form, blend shapes, cages, etc.

Most common method is Linear Blend Skinning (LBS)
  articulation parameters are affine transforms specified by a handle

handles used to be just bones but now there are point handles, region handles,
  cage vertices, and abstract handles.

In some cases it is only desirable to specify the translational component
  Ex. Motion Capture unsure of spine configuration

This method computes the unspecified degrees of freedom by minimizing the
  elastic energy

Express energy only in terms of handle transformations
Uses input skinning weights to determine parts of the shape that are likely
  to be transformed similarly and simplify the deformation energy accordingly

Computing missing degrees of freedom -> similar to inverse kinematics but shape
  aware

Inverse Kinematics is performed on the skeleton not the shape
IK cannot handle disconnected skeletons or surface handles

Shape Deformation Research has concentrated on two main fronts:
  modelling physically plausible deformations
  exposing very fast and parallelizable deformations

Nonlinear energies are harder to optimize but give higher quality deformations

Quadratic energies that lead to linear optimizations are fast, but lead
  to linearization artifacts

What are dense subspace models?

influence of cage handles on points is done by using barycentric coordinates

How to define the influence of each handle on every point?

What is an isoline?

Clustering vertices in weight space because vertices with similar weights
  will have similar deformation gradients which allows using a small number
  of rotation groups.

Many linear deformation problems suffer from the problem of "translation-
  sensitivity"
