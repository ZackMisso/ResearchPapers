Purpose: Proposed system where the user defines the degrees of freedom
  and the rest are automatically inferred using nonlinear, rigidity energies

What is Fast Variational Shape Modeling?

Articulation has two steps:
  Rigging - setting how the parameters control the geometry
  Deformation - calculates the shape based on parameters

Joint angles are usually the most popular articulation parameter
Others:
  free-form, blend shapes, cages, etc.

Most common method is Linear Blend Skinning (LBS)
  articulation parameters are affine transforms specified by a handle

handles used to be just bones but now there are point handles, region handles,
  cage vertices, and abstract handles.

In some cases it is only desirable to specify the translational component
  Ex. Motion Capture unsure of spine configuration

This method computes the unspecified degrees of freedom by minimizing the
  elastic energy
