CostEffectivePrintingOf3DObjectsWithSkinFrameStructures

Authors: Weiming Wang Tuanfeng Wang Zhouwang Yang

Purpose: Reduce material cost by designing a skin frame structure
Number of struts is minimized by solving an l sparsity optimization
Uses powder-type and extrusion-type 3D printers.

What is l0 sparsity optimization?

Structural Optimization Problem -> optimal set of frame struts -> NP-Hard
  Genetic Algorithms have been applied but are only suitable for small scale

Related things:
  Structural Analysis
  Segmentation
  Articulated Model Generation
  Balancing Shape
  Finite Element Analysis of Stress -> using struts is efficient

This paper proposes a solution to keep stability and reduce volume of material used
3D Printed Objects require Geometric Approximation of their shape

What is a Multi-Objective Programming Problem in the context of this paper?
