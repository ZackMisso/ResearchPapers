FastLatticeShapeMatchingForRobustRealTimeDeformation

Authors: Alec R. Rivers Doug L. James : Cornell

Purpose: Robust Approximation of Volumetric, large-deformation dynamics
  for real-time or large-scale offline simulations

Lattice Shape Matching -> extension of Deformable Shape Matching to regular
  lattices with embedded geometry
What is Deformable Shape Matching?

lattice vertices are smoothed by convolution of rigid shape matching operators
  on local lattice regions.

per-vertex cost scale cubically with region width

Fast Lattice Shape Matching -> exploits inherent summation redundancy of shape
  matching and can provide large region matching at constant per-vertex cost

Use rigid shape matching transforms that use regional estimates of rotation
  and translation at every lattice location to provide detailed deformation
  smoothing without domain boundary artifacts.

naive lattice shape matching with modest filter widths is O(N^3)

Lattice-based shape deformers cleanly separate deformation modeling complexity
  from geometric complexity and surface representation.

Read about semi-implicit integration

What is trilinear interpolation?

Lattice deformation is controlled by unit point-mass particles placed at the
  lattice cell vertex

Each particle has a list of neighbors that share at least one lattice cell
  with it.

Need to make sire particles in many regions are not weighted more than others

The geometric models being simulated are analogous to elastically deformable
  models.
