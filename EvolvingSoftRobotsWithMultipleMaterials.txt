Limit to Rigid Body Morphologies. Actual organisms are soft

Direct Encodings lack the regularity and evolvability necessary to
  consistently produce regular morphologies and coordinated behavior.

CPPN-NEAT has been shown to create complex regularities such as symmetry
  and repetition

Many genetic encodings do not scale well to high parameter spaces.
Large computational cost in in simulating flexible materials
Evolutionary algorithms excel at multiple competing and difficult-to-define
  objectives

What is the MOLE algorithm?
How to evolve material properties?
