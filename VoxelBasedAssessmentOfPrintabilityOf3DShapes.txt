VoxelBasedAssessmentOfPrintabilityOf3DShapes

Authors: Alexandru Telea, Andrei Jalba

What is geodesic analysis?

Since 3D printing works in raster fashion voxel approximations
can be used.

This paper relies on multi-scale morphology and geodesic analysis

Shape details thinner than the printer resolution results
  in empty voxels

local thickness detection is a necessary part of printability
  detection

Previous work:
  Define local thickness at point p as the diameter of the
    largest inscribed ball B centered at x that contains p
  This ^ was implemented by evaluating the distance transform
    over the skeleton (or medial axis) and marking all points
    with the maximum of D|Om.
    This method requires a robust and exact medial axis
      transform, which is prohibitively expensive for large voxel
      models.
  Other ides was to compute thickness between surface pairs
    by minimal-length surface-to-surface paths using a PDE-based
    approach.
    Fast but no extension to higher-genus models.
  Mesh-based methods
    require a clean mesh with no self-intersections
    no volumetric object representation
    only work well on simple shapes and hard to implement

  We do not have a digitization process under our control
  and we have a quality criteria.
  We must assess whether a given polygonal model fullfils
    these criteria under the given digitization.

  A 3D shape is printable when the removal of its thin regions
    do not create critical topological or geometrical changes.

  Critical changes are defined as:
    disappearance of salient detail, or spikes
    disconnection of large shape fragments by removal of bridges
    creation of large holes, also called tunnels

  Use previous voxelization method based on binvox

  Voxelization resolution used in practice exceeds that of the
    3D printer, so small potential errors caused by the voxelization
    methods should have no effect on our assessment.

  Detect the locally thin areas. This can be formulated as a top-hat
    transform in the context of multi-scale morphology.

  Erode then dilate the object

  Take the set difference between the morphed object and the input
    and you have the parts that do not get printed

  Classify voxels into four categories
    thin
    rump
    interface
    boundary
