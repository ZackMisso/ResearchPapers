Laplace-Beltrami operator

trace of the Hessian

Laplace = sum of eiganvalues of the Hessian

Size of eiganvalues infers the energy

Care about only low frequency eiganfunctions

Heat Kernels

Solve for Heat Diffusion

Heat Kernel takes in 2 points and measure value at point y at time t.

How fast does temp reach equilibrium at a point -> gives you info about
  the local geometry. Relationship between curvature and heat

What is Brownian Motion. And Random Walks

Auto Diffusion Function

Isometric Deformation?
