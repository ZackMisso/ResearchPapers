There are various representations of object materials

There are discrete representations and continuous representations

Composite representations are representations that have sub-objects
  whose representations are either discrete or continuous

Hybrid representations can use both discrete and continuous in simultaneous
  conjunction

Discrete Representations:
  Voxels
  Volume Meshes

Continuous Representations:
  Control Points
  Geometric Functions

Voxels:
  Easily parallelizable
  Simple
  Good for volumetrically scanned data and complex objects

To Be Continued

Control Points:
  Continuous, utilizes Bezier, B-Spline volumes and tri-variate NURBS.
  Requires geometry and composition representation
  limits complexity, versus usability
