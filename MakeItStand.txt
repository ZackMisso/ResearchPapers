MakeItStand: BalencingShapesFor3DFabrication

Authors: Romain Prevost, Emily Whiting, ETH Zurich

Purpose: To change the internal structure of a 3D printed object so that it can
stand on its own. Formulates Balance Optimization as an Energy Minimization
formula.

Asymmetric Balance -> Aesthetic

Carves and Deforms the object to meet equilibrium
-> Interactive design, user can specify if it is not correct
Considers suspended and standing objects on flat surfaces

Previous Work:
  Printability of an object can be understood through voxelization
  Plausible not feasible -> center of mass approximated by a sum of masses
    located at the barycenter of the bones
  Consider stability of an asembledge of parts consisting of simple solids
