How do you write down the potential energy of different elastic materials?

Given the energy of a system we can compute force using the relationship
  F = -DE (derivative of energy with respect to the objects degrees of
           freedom)

Energy contains the same information content as the forces, but it is
  easier to write down since it is just a scalar.

The forces that arise from potential energies must be conservative

As such, Dampening, Friction, and other dissipative phenomena cannot be
  explained as arising from a potential energy.

A material with the property that its internal forces come from a
  potential is called HYPERELASTIC.

Simplest elastic object is a spring in 1D
  at rest when p = L

Hooke's Law: E = .5 * k * (|p| - L)^2

The energy E depends only on the stretchedness (strain) epsilon of the
  spring

The energy is zero when epsilon = 0

The energy is nonnegative

energy is minimized when the spring isnt stretched or compressed

The absolute energy doesnt matter. Forces only depend on the relative
  change in energy DE. But we shift the energy to be 0 when it is at
  rest

The strain (epsilon) of a spring:
  epsilon = (|p| - L) / L

^ Cauchy Strain -> simplest formula

Why is epsilon relative to the rest length L instead of the current
  length p?

It doesn't matter

epsilon is unit less

Green Strain -> epsilon = (p^2 - L^2) / 2L^2

Green strain is used heavily in higher dimensions

From the First Law we know that energy must be a function of epsilon

E(p) = E~(epsilon(p)) for some function
