How do you write down the potential energy of different elastic materials?

Given the energy of a system we can compute force using the relationship
  F = -DE (derivative of energy with respect to the objects degrees of
           freedom)

Energy contains the same information content as the forces, but it is
  easier to write down since it is just a scalar.

The forces that arise from potential energies must be conservative

As such, Dampening, Friction, and other dissipative phenomena cannot be
  explained as arising from a potential energy.

A material with the property that its internal forces come from a
  potential is called HYPERELASTIC.

Simplest elastic object is a spring in 1D
  at rest when p = L

Hooke's Law: E = .5 * k * (|p| - L)^2

The energy E depends only on the stretchedness (strain) epsilon of the
  spring

The energy is zero when epsilon = 0

The energy is nonnegative

energy is minimized when the spring isnt stretched or compressed

The absolute energy doesnt matter. Forces only depend on the relative
  change in energy DE. But we shift the energy to be 0 when it is at
  rest

The strain (epsilon) of a spring:
  epsilon = (|p| - L) / L

^ Cauchy Strain -> simplest formula

Why is epsilon relative to the rest length L instead of the current
  length p?

It doesn't matter

epsilon is unit less

Green Strain -> epsilon = (p^2 - L^2) / 2L^2

Green strain is used heavily in higher dimensions

From the First Law we know that energy must be a function of epsilon

E(p) = E~(epsilon(p)) for some function

plasticity -> permanent damage taken by a deformed object

Two pieces of information are required to specify the
  behavior of the spring
    The strain formula used for epsilon
    The material model, consisting of the coefficients

Elasticity -> Objects that can be defined by some potential

potential is defined in terms of some strain

derivative of potential gives you force

force depends on derivative of the strain

derivative is always taken with respect to degrees of freedom

strain formulation can be chosen freely, but material model must
  be chosen with respect to that strain

the degrees of freedom of a rubber band are now all possible
  deformations of Omega.

which is represented using an embedding function

The image of that function is then the deformed rubber band

Tangent vectors on the undeformed rubber band are mapped to
  the deformed rubber band by the deformation derivative D%

An alternate way to measure stretchedness is to measure the change
  in the length of tangent vectors drawn at a point

Using the function %, we have infinitely many degrees of freedom

Identity embedding %(xb) = x which just gives Omegab = Omega

Rigid translations of the rubber band %(xb) = xb + t

Uniform stretching of the rubber band to deformed length :
  %(xb) = xbL/Lb

The goal is to find a function E(%)

A function of a function is called a functional

the energy function is local it can be written as the integral over Omegab
  of W(xb)dxb

Where W is the energy density

The energy density W at a point xb in Omegab depends only on the
  stretchedness (strain) epsilon(xb) at that point on the rubber band

The energy density is zero when epsilon = 0

The energy density is non-negative

Main change: energy is now expressed as an integral of a local energy
  density

Force = D%ofE

What does it mean to take the derivatice of the functional E with respect
  to a function %?

Intuitively F measures the direction of steepest descent. The way % needs
  to change to quickly decrease the total energy of the system.

Measuring the stretching og vb is the same as measuring the change in
  distance between xb and a test point yb = xb + &vb for an infinitesimal
  parameter &

v = D%(xb)vb i.e. v = partial of % with respect to xb (xb) dot vb
